    This app allows you to register a <strong>.eth</strong> name for use in ethereum decentralized applications (dapps) and compatible blockchain browsers. Names are not <em>bought</em> from any particular organization and there is no central entity receiving any funds for this, all ether spent on this app that isn't being used to pay transactions fees is either temporarily locked or burned.

    To claim a name, you must be willing to put some amount of ether in a contract that will make it illiquid for as long as you want to keep the name, the minimum length being a year. Once a name has been requested, there will be a period of 120 hours in which anyone can put a sealed bid for it, sent with funds (minimum of 0.01 ether). This period is followed by a 48h revealing period in which bids must be revealed (or the funds will be lost). The highest bidder will become the owner, and they will immediately be refunded of the ether they sent, minus the value required to outbid the second highest bidder. The remaining funds are kept locked in a contract for at least a year, and after that the owner can be refunded of it by releasing their ownership of the name.  After names are owned, they will be controlled only by their owners, which will be able to transfer or release them, until it needs to be renewed. The contract is expected to be upgraded by 2019 to create small renewal costs, to discourage long term squatting and gold-rushing.
