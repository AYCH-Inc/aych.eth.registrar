    <h1> Ethereum Name System</h1>

    <h2> What is it and what it's not </h2>
    <p>
        The ENS is a system that was created to provide shorter, more human-friendly names in place of long addresses, such as ethereum addresses or swarm hashes that are often used in the ethereum ecosystem.    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>ENS is not a domain system:</strong> In the sense of internet domains, as managed by ICANN, ENS is not a domain system. While it can be used in a similar fashion on apps that replicate browser functionality, like Mist or Metamask, there is no claim on the ".eth" top level domain system, which can only be managed by ICANN.
    </p><p>
        <strong>ENS is not a trademark or any sort of claim on ownership:</strong> owning a ENS name is a fully automated process and does not indicate ownership of any given trademowning an ENS name is a fully automated process and does not indicate ownership of any given trademark, copyright, brand name or any other kind of intellectual property.

    </p><p>
        <strong>Names are not sold:</strong> ENS names are not sold or leased by any party or entity. While the process of claiming a name involves locking or burning funds, these processes were created to disincentive spamming and try to it make so that names are only claimed by users who will make use of them. All ether spent on the process is either given back to the bidder after some time, sent to a burn address or sent to a miner.


    </p>

    <h2> How the process works </h2>
    <p>
        <strong>The process of claiming a name takes 5 days and requires multiple transactions that are time sensitive and often irreversible, so it will be important for you to fully understand the process to ensure you do not irreversibly lose your ether. </strong> 
    </p> <p> 
        Users start the process by opening a public auction for the name they want, which will send an alert that can be seen to anyone watching the blockchain for that specific name. After the auction is opened anyone who knows how to spell that name can bid for it in the next five days, by sending a transaction with the maximum amount they are willing to pay for the name. Bids are accepted until 120 hours after the initial auction was opened, and after that time, the reveal phase starts. <strong> During the next 48 hours, anyone who bids must reveal their bids (failing to do so will result in irreversible loss of funds)</strong>.
    </p> <p>
        The bidder who was willing to pay the most for the name will be the owner, but they will only pay an amount equal to the amount the second largest bidder wanted. Only one bid is required, therefore bid your theoretical maximum on the desired name. 
 
    </p> <p>
        Once an auction is finished, the user needs to finalize their name, to finish the auction, and at that point they will be able to transfer ownership to someone else, add a subregistrar (subdomain.foobarz.eth) or add record types associated with the name (ethereum address, bitcoin address, swarm content, etc). 

    </p> <p>
        After one year the owner can release the name back to the market and get back the ether they deposited on it, if they so wish. After two years it is expected that an updated version of the registrar will be deployed which might require some sort of recurring fee, deposit or some other way to encourage unused names to be released back in the market.

    </p>

    <h2> What names are valid? </h2>

    <p>
        As names are hashed during the auction process to increase privacy, any name, string or file could, in theory be owned via this process. Names that are shorter than 7 characters are considered reserved until the system is more mature and if registered, they can be invalidated, which will result in irreversible loss of funds by the claimer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Names that use any character beyond alphanumeric (and hyphen and underscore), while valid, are not guaranteed to be resolved by the client as it's up to each implementation, so it is discouraged to register names with accented characters, non-latin characters, emojis or any other type of non-word hash.
    </p>

    <h2> How much it costs </h2>

    <p>
        Besides usual transaction costs, these are the costs of each type of transaction:

        <ul>
            <li>
                Opening an auction costs about 575k gas. This is a more expensive step because it actually opens 9 dummy auctions besides the one you want, in random order, to discourage an automated bidder to bid on every open auction.
            </li>
            <li>
                Putting up a secret bid costs 325k gas, plus all the ether required to cover your bid, and some extra ether to add anonymity on the exact value of your bid. The minimum amount required for a bid is 0.01 ether.
            </li>
        </ul>

        When bids are revealed, any extra ether sent to add anonymity will be returned in full. Some fees will occur on proportional to the value of your bid, to discourage spamming. These fees are the following:

        <ul>
            <li>
                Bids that are below the value that the current winner is willing to pay, and bids that are below the overall minimum: 0.5% is burned, 99.5% is returned.

            </li>
            <li>
                Bids that are above the current winner will be locked. If any new bid displaces it, then the same 0.5% burn will be applied and the remainder 99.5% will be returned. Once the auction is over, the winning bid is locked for at least one year.            
            </li>
            <li>
                Bids that are not revealed on time are 99.5% burned. The extra ether beyond the given value will be returned, but the amount bid will be 100% destroyed.

            </li>
            <li>
                Bids not revealed for more than 4 weeks are by definition invalid and can be cleared by anyone, even if they are still anonymous. In this case, the user doing the clearing will get 0.5% of the full deposit of the bid, but the remainder will be burnt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Names that are discovered to be invalidated will lose half of their current deposit. Anyone can invalidate a name: 50% of the deposit will go the user doing the invalidation, and the remained be returned to the owner of the invalidated name.
            </li>
        </ul>

    </p>
